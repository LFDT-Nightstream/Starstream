## Report Intakes

This project offer the following ways to submit security vulnerabilities. While
the security team members will do their best to respond to bugs disclosed in all
possible ways, it is encouraged for bug finders to report through the following
approved channels:

- Email the [LF Decentralized Trust security email list]: To report a security issue, please
send an email with the name of the project/repository, a description of the issue, the
steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known,
mitigations. If in triaging the email, the security team determines the issue may be
a security vulnerability, a [GitHub security vulnerability report] will be
opened.
- Open a [GitHub security vulnerability report]: Open a draft security advisory
on the "Security" tab of this GitHub repository. See [GitHub Security
Advisories](#github-security-advisories) to learn more about the security
infrastructure in GitHub.

## Embargo List

This project does not maintain an embargo list because currently we do not have
large-scale downstream deployments that require advance notice.
