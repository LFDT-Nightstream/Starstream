# Starstream

Starstream is a Virtual Machine ("VM") and language uses coroutines as its core primitive.
The end goal is for Starstream to be a powerful primitive that can power decentralized systems like blockchains.

Unique features of Starstream:

- Support for local private computation & transaction batching via folding schemes (relatively new technology),
- UTXO-based (only zkVM in development with this property),
- Coroutines & effects as its core primitive (only blockchain VM that does this)
