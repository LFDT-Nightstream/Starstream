Starstream is a VM concept that uses delimited continuations as its core primitive.
The end goal is a language and VM that can be used across any blockchain that chooses to include it.

Unique features of Starstream:

- Native folding scheme support for both on variable updates & function application (only VM that provides both)
- UTXO-based (only zkVM in development with this property)
- Delimited continuations as its core primitive (only blockchain VM that does this)
