# Rationale / "Why Another VM?"

> _This page explains the motivation and reasoning behind creating Starstream as a new virtual machine, and why existing solutions were not sufficient._

Established blockchain Virtual Machines (VMs) like Ethereum's EVM or Cardano's Plutus VMs have set robust foundations and created vibrant ecosystems. Given their demonstrated success, introducing another VM like Starstream requires a thoughtful rationale, especially when seeking community support.

Starstream aims to address specific, important trade-offs and limitations in existing VMs by embracing a future-oriented design, placing zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies at its core, and dramatically improving how blockchain applications are built, upgraded, and maintained.

## Why Zero-Knowledge (ZK) is Essential for the Future

Blockchain networks increasingly face demands for scalability, privacy, and efficient data handling. Zero-Knowledge (ZK) technology has emerged as one of the most promising solutions, providing:

- **Enhanced Scalability:** ZK enables transactions and computations to be batched and verified succinctly, drastically increasing throughput and efficiency.
- **Privacy and Data Protection:** ZK proofs allow verification without revealing underlying sensitive information, crucial for regulated real-world assets, secure DeFi operations, and competitive gaming.
- **Compliance and Practicality:** Regulatory environments worldwide increasingly require blockchains to manage confidential transactions responsibly. ZK offers a viable path forward that is both compliant and user-friendly.

Because of these powerful advantages, integrating ZK into blockchain VMs is becoming critical, not optional, for future blockchain platforms.

## Unparalleled Upgradability for ZK Technologies

Many existing blockchain VMs were initially built without ZK in mind, requiring expensive retrofitting or complete rewrites when adopting ZK innovations. For example, historical upgrades in some platforms have resulted in extensive redevelopment costs reaching into millions of dollars.

Starstream introduces a fundamentally different approach—separating memory constraints from opcode handling. In Starstream, UTXOs are treated purely as evolving memory states rather than opcode-dependent machines locked to specific VM implementations. This design has significant advantages:

- **Minimal Upgrade Costs:** Adopting newer and more efficient ZK proving systems becomes straightforward, eliminating expensive and slow rewrites.
- **Automatic Adoption of Innovation:** With ZK technologies rapidly improving (approximately 10× per year), Starstream naturally inherits these advancements without significant development overhead.
- **Flexibility Across zkVM Backends:** Starstream is currently being developed using Nebula but is designed to switch effortlessly to new zkVM implementations like MicroNova, staying continuously aligned with cutting-edge ZK research.
- **Developer and Project Efficiency:** By abstracting away ZK and VM complexities, teams using Starstream can focus their energy fully on their core applications, rather than continuous VM maintenance.

## Built-in ZK Capabilities for Real-world Needs

Starstream's coroutine-based architecture integrates ZK as a core, foundational element rather than as an afterthought. Practically, this enables:

- **Efficient Transaction Batching Compression:** Starstream batches transactions down to just 16 kilobytes, roughly equivalent to two standard Cardano transactions. This efficiency dramatically improves real-world use cases like asset tracking, DeFi transaction sequences across multiple protocols, and high-frequency gaming actions.
- **Native Privacy:** Transactions can easily manage private metadata, ideal for compliance with data privacy regulations, protection from front-running in DeFi, and privacy-sensitive gaming mechanics ("fog-of-war").

## Incremental Verification and Simple ZK Maintenance

Starstream's coroutine model naturally aligns with Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC), a powerful ZK primitive increasingly essential in blockchain scalability. Benefits include:

- **Straightforward Integration of ZK Innovations:** Upgrading to newer, faster, and better ZK proving systems is much simpler with Starstream compared to traditional VMs.
- **Lower Technical Debt:** Ongoing improvements in ZK become easy to adopt, maintaining competitive performance with minimal ongoing engineering effort.

## Operational Simplicity & Better Observability

EVM-like architectures suffer from global-state complexity and auditing difficulties, while traditional UTXO models, despite isolated states, require cumbersome transaction chaining. Starstream, using coroutine-based composability, resolves these operational challenges and simplifies observability, making development and debugging more straightforward for developers and operators alike.

## Decentralization & Ecosystem Resilience

Depending on a single VM architecture introduces potential risks such as single points of failure or stagnation. Offering a VM like Starstream, built on different foundational principles, fosters diversity, decentralization, and resilience within blockchain ecosystems.

## Comparison with Existing Solutions

Below is a clear, transparent comparison summarizing Starstream's design trade-offs against traditional UTXO VMs and the EVM:

| Feature                | Starstream                  | Traditional UTXO VMs         | EVM                        |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Upgradability          | Complete ISA independence   | Often requires full rewrites | Limited by EVM design      |
| Contract Composition   | Native via coordination scripts | Complex transaction chaining | Native but with global state overhead |
| Token Implementation   | First-class coroutines      | Separate tokens standards    | Separate token standards   |
| ZK Compatibility       | Built-in by design          | Often retrofitted            | Challenging due to global state |
| Development Complexity | Low (single primitive)      | High (multiple concepts)     | Medium-High                |
| Error Handling         | Clean resumable exceptions  | Often manual state tracking  | Try/catch but no resumability |
| Parallelism Potential  | High (localized state)      | High (but complex)           | Limited (global state)     |
| Upgrade Costs          | Minimal                     | Potentially millions of dollars | Medium                  |

In short, Starstream transparently addresses existing VM limitations by explicitly designing around ZK technology from the start, offering superior flexibility, operational simplicity, and future-proofing. The intention is not merely to compete with existing solutions but to complement and advance the blockchain landscape, facilitating the next wave of blockchain adoption through clear, purposeful innovation.
