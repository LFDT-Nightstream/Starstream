# E0014: Duplicate Struct Field

A struct definition contains the same field name more than once.

## Example

```starstream
struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
    x: i64,  // Error: field `x` appears multiple times in struct `Point`
}
```

## How to fix

Remove the duplicate field or give it a unique name:

```starstream
struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
    z: i64,  // OK
}
```
