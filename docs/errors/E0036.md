# E0036: Unknown Import Interface

You tried to import an interface that doesn't exist in the specified package.

## Example

```starstream
import { something } from starstream:std/nonexistent;  // Error: unknown interface `starstream:std/nonexistent`
```

## How to fix

Check that the interface name is spelled correctly and exists in the package:

```starstream
import { blockHeight } from starstream:std/cardano;  // OK - valid interface
```
