# E0039: Effectful Without Raise

You called an effectful function without using the `raise` keyword.

Effectful functions raise effects that can be caught, handled, and resumed by effect handlers. The `raise` keyword must be used at the call site to acknowledge this.

## How to fix

Use the `raise` keyword when calling effectful functions:

```starstream
let result = raise some_effectful_function();  // OK
```
