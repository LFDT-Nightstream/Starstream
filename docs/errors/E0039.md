# E0039: Effectful Without Raise

You called an effectful function without using the `raise` keyword.

Effectful functions are functions that have side effects and must be explicitly marked at the call site with `raise` to acknowledge the effect.

## How to fix

Use the `raise` keyword when calling effectful functions:

```starstream
let result = raise some_effectful_function();  // OK
```
