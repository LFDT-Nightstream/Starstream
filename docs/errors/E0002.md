# E0002: Variable Redeclaration

You tried to declare a variable that already exists in the current scope.

## Example

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let x = 10;  // Error: variable `x` is already defined in this scope
}
```

## How to fix

Use a different name for the new variable:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;  // OK
}
```

Or, if you want to reassign the variable, declare it as mutable:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    x = 10;  // OK
}
```
