# E0041: Runtime Without Keyword

You called a runtime function without using the `runtime` keyword.

Runtime functions are functions that access runtime-only information (like block height) and must be explicitly marked at the call site with `runtime`.

## How to fix

Use the `runtime` keyword when calling runtime functions:

```starstream
import { blockHeight } from starstream:std/cardano;

let height = runtime blockHeight();  // OK
```
