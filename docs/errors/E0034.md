# E0034: Event Argument Type Mismatch

You passed an argument to an event with a type that doesn't match the expected parameter type.

## Example

```starstream
abi Events {
    event Transfer(from: i64, to: i64);
}

fn main() {
    emit Transfer(1, true);  // Error: event `Transfer` argument 2 has type `bool` but `i64` was expected
}
```

## How to fix

Pass an argument of the correct type:

```starstream
abi Events {
    event Transfer(from: i64, to: i64);
}

fn main() {
    emit Transfer(1, 2);  // OK
}
```
