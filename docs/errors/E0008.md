# E0008: General Type Mismatch

The type of an expression doesn't match the expected type.

## Example

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x: bool = 42;  // Error: expected type `bool`, found `i64`
}
```

## How to fix

Ensure the expression has the correct type:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x: bool = true;  // OK
}
```

Or adjust the type annotation:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x: i64 = 42;  // OK
}
```
