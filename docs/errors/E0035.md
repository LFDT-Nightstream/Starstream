# E0035: Unknown Import Package

You tried to import from a package that doesn't exist or isn't available.

## Example

```starstream
import { something } from foo:bar/baz;  // Error: unknown package `foo:bar`
```

## How to fix

Check that the package namespace and name are spelled correctly and that the package is available:

```starstream
import { blockHeight } from starstream:std/cardano;  // OK - valid package
```
