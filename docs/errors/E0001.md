# E0001: Unknown Variable

You tried to use a variable that hasn't been declared.

## Example

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x = y + 1;  // Error: `y` is not defined
}
```

## How to fix

Make sure the variable is declared before you use it:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let y = 10;
    let x = y + 1;  // OK
}
```

Or check for typos in the variable name.
