# E0026: Unsupported Type Feature

You used a type feature that isn't currently supported by the compiler.

## Example

This error appears when using advanced type features that haven't been implemented yet, such as certain generic patterns or complex type constructs.

## How to fix

Simplify your type usage to use only supported features. Check the Starstream documentation for currently supported type features.
