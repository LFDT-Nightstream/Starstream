# E0006: Binary Operator Type Mismatch

The operands of a binary operator don't have matching or compatible types.

## Example

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x = 5 + true;  // Error: binary `+` operands must match; found `i64` and `bool`
}
```

## How to fix

Ensure both operands have the same type:

```starstream
fn main() {
    let x = 5 + 10;      // OK: both are i64
    let y = true && false;  // OK: both are bool
}
```
