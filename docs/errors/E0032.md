# E0032: Argument Type Mismatch

You passed an argument with a type that doesn't match the expected parameter type.

## Example

```starstream
fn square(n: i64) -> i64 {
    n * n
}

fn main() {
    square(true);  // Error: argument 1 has type `bool` but `i64` was expected
}
```

## How to fix

Pass an argument of the correct type:

```starstream
fn square(n: i64) -> i64 {
    n * n
}

fn main() {
    square(5);  // OK
}
```
